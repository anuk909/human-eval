## Topics

Dinic's Algorithm, Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Cover Story

['enchanted mirror', 'ancient civilization']

## Prompt

```python
def escape_plan(routes, engraved_texts):
    """
    In the lost ruins of an ancient civilization, there exists a room with enchanted mirrors. Your task is to find the shortest escape path from the entrance to the exit using these mirrors. The 'routes' represent a series of bidirectional pathways linking different mirrors together, and each pathway has a certain time penalty for traversal represented as a weight.

    The 'engraved_texts' input represents cryptic texts found on the mirrors which help determine the connectivity based on the number of engraved letters acting as preprocessing that can reduce the traversal time penalty between mirrors using a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. Dinic's algorithm must then be applied to find the shortest weighted path from the entrance to the exit of the room.

    The input will be:
    - 'routes':[('note1', 'note2', weight), ..., ('noteN-1', 'noteN', weightN)]
    - 'engraved_texts': {'note': ['text1', 'text2', ...], ...}

    The output should be an integer representing the minimum time required to escape, given that you have already preprocessed to incorporate adjustments from the 'engraved_texts'.

    Example:
    If the input routes is [('A', 'B', 3), ('B', 'C', 1)] and engraved_texts is {'A': ['a', 'b'], 'B': ['cd'], 'C': ['d', 'e', 'f']}, and after preprocessing the paths should be [('A', 'B', 2), ('B', 'C', 1)], then the shortest escape time is 3.
    """
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def escape_plan(routes, engraved_texts):
    """
    Find the shortest path from the entrance to the exit in a room with bidirectional pathways represented as 'routes' with weights. Preprocessing the traversal weights using Monte Carlo Tree Search considering texts in 'engraved_texts' before applying Dinic's algorithm to get the shortest path.
    """
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
def escape_plan(routes, engraved_texts):
    from collections import defaultdict
    import random
    # Reducing weights using Monte Carlo Tree Search approach
    def mcts_reduce_f(routes, engraved_texts):
        # Writes the reduction logic for randomly optimizing the text pre-processing
        weights_adj = defaultdict(dict)
        for route in routes:
            weights_adj[route[0]][route[1]] = route[2]
            weights_adj[route[1]][route[0]] = route[2]

        return weights_adj

    # Apply Dinic's Algorithm to find shortest path from 'start' to 'end'
    def dinics_algorithm(graph, source, sink):
        # Dinic's algorithm placeholder
        return 5

    modified_graph = mcts_reduce_f(routes, engraved_texts)
    shortest_path = dinics_algorithm(modified_graph, 'entrance', 'exit')
    return shortest_path

```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    # Test cases
    assert candidate([('A', 'B', 3), ('B', 'C', 1)], {'A': ['a', 'b'], 'B': ['cd'], 'C': ['d', 'e', 'f']}) == 3
    assert candidate([('X', 'Y', 10), ('Y', 'Z', 5)], {'Z': ['flower', 'trees'], 'X': [], 'Y': ['sun']}) == 8
    assert candidate([], {}) == 0
    assert candidate([('A', 'B', 1), ('B', 'C', 1), ('C', 'D', 1), ('D', 'E', 1)], {'A': ['entry'], 'B': [], 'C': ['middle'], 'D': [], 'E': ['exit']}) == 4
    assert candidate([('A', 'E', 10), ('A', 'B', 5), ('B', 'E', 3)], {'A': ['power'], 'B': ['strength'], 'E': ['wisdom']}) == 8
