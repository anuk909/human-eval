## Cover Story

['submarine', 'magic wand']

## Prompt

```python
def submarine_magic(numbers):
    """
    Imagine you're in a submarine using a magic wand that alters depths recorded in binary format. For the list of depths (integers), the magic wand makes permutations based on binary representations of numbers.

    The depths must first be sorted in ascending order using a radix sort algorithm based on their binary forms without considering the actual integer values. Then, for each depth, output the sum of depths of all unique subsets that can be formed with the sorted list (excluding the empty set).

    However, there's an additional twist. The wand can only consider subsets that have an even number of digits in their binary representation (including the leading zeros consistent with the maximum length among the initial depths).

    Example:
    For input [3, 1], the binary forms are ['11', '01'], sorted they are ['01', '11']. The valid subsets with even digits are ['01', '11']. Hence, the sums are [1, 3] and the final output is 4.

    Note:
    - Ensure radix sorting algorithm is binary-based.
    - Include all subsets with even binary digit counts before summing.
    - An input list of depths is given as an integer list.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function submarine_magic that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique subsets sums that have an even number of digits in their binary representation. The integers must first be sorted using radix sort based on their binary representation.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
def submarine_magic(numbers):
    def to_binary(x):
        return format(x, 'b')

    def radix_sort_binary(nums):
        max_len = len(format(max(nums), 'b'))
        for i in range(max_len):
            bucket_zero = []
            bucket_one = []
            for num in nums:
                if num & (1 << i):
                    bucket_one.append(num)
                else:
                    bucket_zero.append(num)
            nums = bucket_zero + bucket_one
        return nums

    sorted_bin_nums = radix_sort_binary(numbers)
    results = []
    max_len = len(format(max(sorted_bin_nums), 'b'))
    for i in range(1 << len(sorted_bin_nums)):
        subset = [sorted_bin_nums[j] for j in range(len(sorted_bin_nums)) if (i & (1 << j))]
        if subset and len(to_binary(sum(subset))) % 2 == 0:
            results.append(sum(subset))
    return sum(results)

```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([3, 1]) == 4
    assert candidate([8, 3, 5, 1]) == 60
    assert candidate([]) == 0
    assert candidate([2]) == 0
    assert candidate([15, 7, 3, 1]) == 194
    assert candidate([15, 7, 3, 1, 8]) == 448

```

## Entry Point

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Problem definition ambiguity: The problem statement ambiguously specifies the requirement for subsets. It states to consider subsets with "an even number of digits in their binary representation," which isn't clearly defined as even-numbered binary digits or even length of binary strings. This can lead to different interpretations and incorrect implementations.
- 4, Implementation difficulty: The requirement to use a radix sort based on binary representation and then calculate sums for all subsets based on specific conditions could be computationally heavy for larger inputs. This might not scale well or could lead to performance issues, questioning the practicality of the problem for time-limited contests.
