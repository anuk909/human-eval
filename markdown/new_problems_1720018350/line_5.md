# Task ID: hard/1

## Topics

['Math', 'Divide and Conquer', 'Monotonic Stack']

## Cover Story

['prehistoric times', 'floating island']

## Prompt

```python
def highest_elevation_path(elevations, steps):
    """
    Imagine you are in prehistoric times, where floating islands exist. Your task is to jump between these floating islands, trying to reach the highest elevation possible in a set number of jumps. Each jump can either go to a higher elevation or stay on the same elevation, you can never move to a lower elevation.

    You are given a list 'elevations' of integers which represent the elevation of each floating island. The 'steps' parameter represents the maximum number of jumps you can make from your starting point at the first island.

    Your function should return the highest elevation you can reach within the given number of steps. If it is not possible to make any jump, the function should return the elevation of the first island.

    Use a combination of Math, Divide and Conquer, and Monotonic Stack strategies for this task.

    Constraints:
    - Islands are linearly positioned.
    - Elevation values and number of steps are positive integers.
    - Elevations list contains at least one element.

    Examples:
    - If elevations = [3, 6, 7, 5, 8], and steps = 2, the output should be 7 (3 -> 6 -> 7).
    - If elevations = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and steps = 4, the output is 1 since all islands are at the same elevation.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that takes a list of integers 'elevations' and an integer 'steps' and returns the highest elevation possible within given number of steps. You can only move to a higher or same elevation with each step.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
def highest_elevation_path(elevations, steps):
    if not elevations or steps == 0:
        return elevations[0]

    def process_segment(segment):
        stack = []
        max_val = segment[0]
        for val in segment:
            while stack and stack[-1] < val:
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(val)
            max_val = max(max_val, val)
        return max_val

    max_elevation = elevations[0]
    segment = [max_elevation]
    for i in range(1, min(len(elevations), steps + 1)):
        if elevations[i] >= max_elevation:
            segment.append(elevations[i])
            max_elevation = process_segment(segment)
    return max_elevation
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([3, 6, 7, 5, 8], 2) == 7
    assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 4) == 1
    assert candidate([5, 7, 6, 8, 10], 3) == 10
    assert candidate([10, 9, 8, 7, 15], 1) == 10
    assert candidate([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4) == 7
```

## Entry Point

`highest_elevation_path`

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Problem Definition Ambiguity: The provided problem statement and examples are ambiguous regarding the behavior when consecutive elevations decrease but then increase again within allowed steps. For instance, with the input elevations = [10, 9, 8, 7, 15], and steps = 1, according to the problem setup, it should be impossible to reach elevation 15 if you can only move to higher or same elevations, conflicting with the test assert candidate([10, 9, 8, 7, 15], 1) == 10 which suggests implicitly resolving at the current highest, not just the first peak or continuing despite declines. Moreover, the canonical solution and test cases seem inconsistent in enforcing or explaining the intended mechanism clearly.
- 5, Implementation Error: The solution logic in `highest_elevation_path` function combined with lack of clarity in requirements states that the elevation evaluation can go beyond defined `steps` if islands continue to increase or remain flat in elevation, potentially violating constraints indirectly described in the task (e.g. example with elevations = [5, 7, 6, 8, 10], steps = 3 functionally yields 10 even if elevation dropped to 6). This potentially leads to unintentionally permitting declines if they lead to an eventual higher elevation within step limits, conflicting with the initial directive "can never move to a lower elevation".
