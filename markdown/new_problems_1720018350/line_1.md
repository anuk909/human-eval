## Prompt

```python
def energy_vortex_intervals(crystals, energy_intervals):
    """
    In the mystical world of Gorgania, you are a magician trying to manipulate energy vortices using your crystal ball. Each crystal has a unique energy signature represented by a time interval during which it can be harnessed to manipulate a vortex.

    You are given two lists:
    - `crystals`: where each crystal is represented as a tuple (start, end) indicating the interval in which it can manipulate energy.
    - `energy_intervals`: where each interval is a critical phase where energy manipulation is necessary to maintain the stability of a vortex.

    Your task is to determine the minimal number of crystals needed to cover all the energy intervals. If an energy interval cannot be completely covered by the available crystals, return -1.

    Each interval (start, end) is inclusive, meaning it goes from 'start' to 'end' both included. Assume that all values are non-negative integers and that the intervals are sorted by their start times. Merge overlapping intervals where necessary.

    Note:
    - Implement this using a combination of dynamic programming (to determine the minimal number of crystals for each interval) and a greedy approach (to decide how to best cover an interval with available crystals).
    - An efficient solution would utilize an approach similar to interval scheduling optimization, where you process the least ending intervals first for a better greedy selection.
    """
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Define a function that, given lists of available crystals' time intervals and required energy manipulations intervals, determines the minimal number of crystals needed to entirely cover all the energy intervals. If at least one interval cannot be covered, return -1.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
def energy_vortex_intervals(crystals, energy_intervals):
        if not energy_intervals:
            return 0
        covered = [-1] * (energy_intervals[-1][1] + 1)
        for start, end in crystals:
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                covered[i] = max(covered[i], end)

        dp = [float('inf')] * (energy_intervals[-1][1] + 2)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
            if covered[i - 1] != -1:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1], 1 + dp[max(0, covered[i - 1] + 1)])

        result = max(dp[energy_intervals[j][1] + 1] for j in range(len(energy_intervals)))
        return -1 if result == float('inf') else result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(1, 3), (4, 10), (8, 12)], [(0, 5), (6, 10)]) == 2
    assert candidate([(1, 5), (4, 8), (10, 15)], [(0, 3), (6, 11)]) == 3
    assert candidate([(1, 3), (6, 9)], [(0, 4), (5, 10)]) == -1
    assert candidate([(0, 3), (2, 8), (9, 10)], [(0, 5), (6, 10)]) == 2
    assert candidate([], [(0, 2)]) == -1
```

## Entry Point

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Unclear Problem Statement: The problem statement's combination of requirements for dynamic programming and greedy algorithm is confusing and contradictory. It suggests using dynamic programming for determining the minimal number of crystals for each interval and a greedy approach simultaneously, which might not be straightforward or even feasible for the described problem.
- 4, Inefficient Canonical Solution: The suggested canonical solution involves a significant amount of iteration over possible ranges, leading to potential inefficiency. For a significant input size, this could lead to performance problems, and it might not scale well.
- 5, Complexity and Feasibility: The task requires merging overlapping intervals and covering them with possibly overlapping ranges from another list, which is inherently complex. The statement requires a specific approach (dynamic programming combined with greedy) without clear justification of why this combination is necessary or optimal, which could mislead readers or result implementational errors.
