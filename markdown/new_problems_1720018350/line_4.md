## Prompt

```python
def illusionist_library_sorting(books, k):
    """
    In a mystical library used by famous illusionists, there are a series of spell books each having a unique enchantment strength represented as an integer in a list called books. The illusionists have a tradition where, before every grand show at the theater, they need to pick books whose combined strength is precisely the k-th strongest possible combination that can be formed with any subset of the books. Each book can only be used once per combination.

    Write a function to find the sum of the strengths of the books in the k-th strongest subset of given books. If there are fewer than k subsets, return 0. For example, if the books have enchantments [1,2,3] and k is 3, the function should return 4 because the third strongest subset is {1, 3} or {2, 2} (if duplicates were allowed).

    Note:
    - If k is negative or 0, return 0.
    - Books list can be empty, and as per the definition, return 0.

    Constraints:
    - Books can have repeated elements.
    - The function should focus on optimal counting and selection methods, considering subsets.

    The problem combines subset/enchantment strength calculation, quick-select for k-th element identification, and combinatorial counting.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def illusionist_library_sorting(books, k):
    """
    Write a function that calculates the sum of the strengths of the books in the k-th strongest subset of a given list of books. Each subset is formed by any combination of books, each book can be used once per subset. If k is negative or 0, or if fewer than k subsets can be formed, return 0. Books list can be empty.
    """

```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    import itertools

    def illusionist_library_sorting(books, k):
        if k <= 0 or not books:
            return 0

        powerset = [subset for i in range(len(books) + 1) for subset in itertools.combinations(books, i)]
        all_sums = sorted([sum(subset) for subset in powerset if subset], reverse=True)
        if len(all_sums) < k:
            return 0
        return all_sums[k-1]
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([1,2,3], 3) == 4
    assert candidate([1,2,3,4], 5) == 6
    assert candidate([4,4,4,5], 3) == 13
    assert candidate([], 1) == 0
    assert candidate([3,5,7], 8) == 0
    assert candidate([10, 10, 10], 1) == 30
    assert candidate([1,2,3], 0) == 0
    assert candidate([1,2,3,-1,0], 4) == 3
```

## Entry Point

`illusionist_library_sorting`

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 4, inconsistency_in_problem_definition: The problem prompt states that "Books can have repeated elements," but under the operational constraints contradicts this by providing test cases with repeated elements leading to specific expected sums. The provided solution and example also use repeated numbers, which implies it's expected that duplicates might change the results, yet the prompt's language and constraints make this unclear.
- 5, potentially_incorrect_tests: One of the test cases asserts `candidate([1,2,3], 3) == 4`, which presupposes the subsets are ranked in a specific, yet undisclosed, order. Additionally, the consistent result in `assert candidate([1,2,3,4], 5) == 6` and `assert candidate([4,4,4,5], 3) == 13` without clarifying how duplication affects outcome rankings leads to confusion. This might lead to different subsets being considered as "strongest" based on undisclosed rules.
