## Cover Story

['portal', 'pirates']

## Prompt

```python
def portal_cipher(str_list, max_k):
    """
    You are a part of a pirate group trying to decode messages that lead to hidden treasures. These messages are given in the form of a list of strings. The treasure location is hidden behind a cipher where you must find the longest palindromic substring in combined strings when you can pass through a portal that allows you to consider any k adjacent strings as one continuous string.

    Implement a function `portal_cipher` that takes a list of strings (str_list) and a maximum integer (max_k) which defines the maximum number of strings you can consider through the portal at once. This function should return the length of the longest palindromic substring that can be found in any combination of up to k adjacent strings.

    Example:
    - If str_list = ['abc', 'cde', 'defg', 'cba'] and max_k = 2, the longest palindromic substring combining any two strings ('abccde', 'cdefg', 'defgcba') is 'cdc' having length 3.

    Note:
    - If str_list is empty or max_k is 0, return 0.
    - Assume that the strings only consist of lowercase English letters.
    - Given an individual string length n, an efficient solution should handle cases where total characters processed does not excessively exceed n^2.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Implement a function 'portal_cipher' that takes a list of strings 'str_list' and an integer 'max_k'. It returns the length of the longest palindromic substring that can be found in any combination of up to 'max_k' adjacent strings in 'str_list'.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Ambiguous complexity constraint: The problem statement mentions that an efficient solution should handle cases where total characters processed do not excessively exceed n^2. However, this is quite ambiguous because it does not specify what constitutes 'excessively' nor does it clarify whether n refers to the length of an individual string or the total cumulative length of string combinations based on max_k, rendering it confusing for devising clear bounds on performance expectations.
- 4, Unaddressed case for overlapping k groups: The prompt does not distinguish how overlaps between string groups should be handled when max_k is greater than 1. For example, when max_k is 3, it could be implied that every combination of up to 3 strings should be checked, but how overlapping groups are handled isn't specified which could lead to inefficiencies or misunderstanding about required combinations.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def longest_palindromic_substring(string):
        n = len(string)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        max_length = 1
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = True
        for start in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for end in range(start + 1, n):
                if string[start] == string[end]:
                    if end - start == 1 or dp[start + 1][end - 1]:
                        dp[start][end] = True
                        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
        return max_length

    def portal_cipher(str_list, max_k):
        if not str_list or max_k == 0:
            return 0
        max_length = 0
        n = len(str_list)
        for length in range(1, min(max_k, n) + 1):
            for start in range(n - length + 1):
                combined = ''.join(str_list[start:start + length])
                max_length = max(max_length, longest_palindromic_substring(combined))
        return max_length
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(['abc', 'cde', 'defg', 'cba'], 2) == 3
    assert candidate(['aaaa', 'bbb', 'aaaa'], 3) == 8
    assert candidate(['abc', 'def', 'ghi'], 2) == 1
    assert candidate(['race', 'car'], 1) == 3
    assert candidate(['wow', 'woow', 'w'], 2) == 6
    assert candidate([], 3) == 0
    assert candidate(['12321', '123'], 2) == 5
    assert candidate(['abc', 'acb', 'bca'], 3) == 3
```
