## Topics

['Monte Carlo Tree Search', "Mo's Algorithm"]

## Cover Story

['hospital', 'magical creatures']

## Prompt

```python
def emergency_triage(patients, queries):
    """
    In the mystical hospital dedicated to treating magical creatures, you are tasked to manage the emergency room's triage system. Each patient is represented by a tuple containing universally unique identifier (UUID as integer), heal score (HS as integer) indicating the gravity of their condition, and the magical species (MS as string).

    Patients are initially given in a list of tuples -- patients. Every day, the Chief Medical Mage sends queries to check on certain statistics from the current queue of patients waiting for care.

    Your goal is to implement a function that processes these queries using a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for decision-making and Mo's Algorithm for efficient data retrieval.

    A query consists of a tuple: ('species', magical_species_indicator),('minimum_heal_score', value) or ('top_uuids', count) and you should return:
    - For ('species', magical_species_indicator): a list of UUIDs of all the patients of the given species sorted by their heal scores in descending order.
    - For ('minimum_heal_score', value): a list of UUIDs of all the patients with a heal score higher than the specified value, sorted by their heal scores in descending order.
    - For ('top_uuids', count): a list of UUIDs of patients with the 'count' highest heal scores, sorted by their heal scores in descending order.

    Assumptions:
    - Reports must be output with the best efficiency possible due to the high volume of daily requests. Mo's Algorithm should be adapted to manage the high number of queries effectively.
    - Decisions about which query to prioritize may be simulated using a basic form of MCTS to estimate the best order to process incoming queries to maximize the efficacy of response times.

    Notes:
    - The UUIDs are all unique positive integers, heal scores are positive integers, and the magical species are non-empty strings.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Implement a function that takes a list of tuples (patients) and a list of tuples (queries) and processes these queries using Monte Carlo Tree Search for decision making and Mo's Algorithm for efficient data retrieval. Patients tuple contains a UUID, a heal score, and the magical species. Queries can ask for patients of certain species, with a minimum heal score, or the top patients by heal score. Returned results should follow the query specifics and should be sorted where applicable.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def emergency_triage(patients, queries):
        # Implementing Mo's Algorithm logic here

        # MCTS for decision making on query order would be orchestrated here

        # Providing solutions to the transformed queries based on above logic

        return
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    patients = [(101, 50, 'dragon'), (102, 75, 'unicorn'), (103, 45, 'pixie'), (104, 80, 'gnome')]
    q1 = [('species', 'dragon'), ('top_uuids', 2)]
    q2 = [('minimum_heal_score', 70), ('top_uuids', 1)]
    assert candidate(patients, q1) == {(101, 50)}, {104, 102})
    assert candidate(patients, q2) == ({102, 104}, {104})
    assert candidate([], []) == ()
    assert candidate([(201, 95, 'goblin')], [('minimum_heal_score', 90)]) == ({201})
```

## Warnings

- Only 4 test cases found. Minimum recommended is 5.
- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Incompatible Algorithm Usage: The problem statement suggests using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for decision-making and Mo's Algorithm for efficient data retrieval. However, MCTS is typically used for decision-making in environments with a sequence of uncertain outcomes, which does not align with the deterministic nature of processing queries. Mo's Algorithm, on the other hand, is specific to offline query processing over static arrays predominantly for range query problems and might not be optimally suited for the described variety of queries which are not bound to range restrictions but involve sorting and complex filtering.
- 4, Over-complex Solutions: The prompt requires implementation of advanced algorithms (MCTS and Mo's Algorithm) which are not straightforward to integrate given the data operations (sorting, filtering by score or type) described. This can lead to an unnecessarily complex solution that may over-complicate the relatively straightforward problem of sorting and querying patient records based on given criteria.
