## Cover Story

['time machine', 'time-bending clock']

## Prompt

```python
def time_machine_sort(times):
    """
    You are given a list of times when a time machine was used. Each time is represented as an integer which corresponds to a unique point in time. In order to maintain the stability of time-travel, it's necessary to sort the times in increasing order so each subsequent use doesn't paradoxically precede its predecessor.

    Since calculating temporal stability is computationally expensive, you've invented a novel combination of merge sort and memoization. While sorting the times using the merge sort algorithm, remember, memoize and reuse the solutions of previously encountered halves of the list to reduce computational overhead. For instance, if two halves of any list have been sorted or merged before, reuse the resolved halves or merged result.

    Implement the `time_machine_sort` function which takes a list of integers, sorts them in increasing order using your novel algorithm and returns the sorted list.

    Note:
    - Given times list can contain duplicate integers representing simultaneous uses.
    - Handle empty lists which represent situations where time-travel hasn't been used.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that takes a list of integers, sorts them in increasing order using a combination of merge sort and memoization, and returns the sorted list.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def merge_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = tuple(arr[:mid])
        right_half = tuple(arr[mid:])

        if left_half in memo:
            sorted_left = memo[left_half]
        else:
            sorted_left = merge_sort(list(left_half))
            memo[left_half] = sorted_left

        if right_half in memo:
            sorted_right = memo[right_half]
        else:
            sorted_right = merge_sort(list(right_half))
            memo[right_half] = sorted_right

        i, j = 0, 0
        sorted_arr = []
        while i < len(sorted_left) and j < len(sorted_right):
            if sorted_left[i] < sorted_right[j]:
                sorted_arr.append(sorted_left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                sorted_arr.append(sorted_right[j])
                j += 1
        sorted_arr.extend(sorted_left[i:])
        sorted_arr.extend(sorted_right[j:])
        return sorted_arr

    memo = {}
    return merge_sort(times)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([2024, 2023, 2025, 2021, 2022]) == [2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025]
    assert candidate([3000, 3000, 2500, 2600, 2400]) == [2400, 2500, 2600, 3000, 3000]
    assert candidate([]) == []
    assert candidate([10000]) == [10000]
    assert candidate([500, 300, 900, 800, 100, 200, 600, 700, 400]) == [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900]
    assert candidate([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Entry Point

`time_machine_sort`

## Warnings

- 4, Missing Base Case in Recursion: The provided canonical solution does not explicitly handle the case where both sorted halves from the memo are reused without needing further merging, which could result in unnecessary computations.
