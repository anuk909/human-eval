# Task ID: hard/1

## Topics

['Backtracking', 'Breadth-First Search']

## Cover Story

['enchanted instrument', 'circus']

## Prompt

```python
def find_shortest_musical_path(music_grid, start, end):
    """
    You are at a circus themed around enchanted musical instruments. The grid represents a map of the circus where each cell contains a unique musical instrument characterized by its string name. Some paths between instruments are blocked and represented by 'X'. Your task is to find the shortest path between the start and end instruments using only adjacent orthogonal movements (no diagonal moves). If no such path exists, return an empty list.

    The function takes three arguments:
    - music_grid: a list of lists where each sublist represents a row in the grid, and each element is either an instrument's name as a string or 'X' for blocked path.
    - start: a tuple of two integers representing the row and column indices in music_grid of the starting instrument.
    - end: a tuple of two integers representing the row and column indices in music_grid of the ending instrument.

    The grid can be thought of as a graph where each cell is a node connected to four possible adjacent nodes (up, down, left, right) that are not blocked. Use Breadth-First Search to determine the shortest path from the start to the end instrument, returning a list of instrument names in order from start to end. If no path exists, return [].
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that finds the shortest path between the starting instrument and ending instrument in a grid, using only orthogonal movements, where some paths may be blocked. Return the path as a list of instrument names in order from start to end. If no path exists, return an empty list.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from collections import deque

    def find_shortest_musical_path(music_grid, start, end):
        nrows, ncols = len(music_grid), len(music_grid[0])
        queue = deque([(start, [music_grid[start[0]][start[1]]])])
        visited = set()
        visited.add(start)
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up

        while queue:
            (row, col), path = queue.popleft()
            if (row, col) == end:
                return path

            for dr, dc in directions:
                r, c = row + dr, col + dc
                if 0 <= r < nrows and 0 <= c < ncols and (r, c) not in visited and music_grid[r][c] != 'X':
                    visited.add((r, c))
                    queue.append(((r, c), path + [music_grid[r][c]]))

        return []
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    grid1 = [
        ['flute', 'violin', 'X', 'saxophone'],
        ['trumpet', 'X', 'drum', 'guitar'],
        ['piano', 'harp', 'clarinet', 'X'],
        ['X', 'X', 'cello', 'accordion']
    ]
    start1, end1 = (0, 0), (2, 2)
    assert candidate(grid1, start1, end1) == ['flute', 'trumpet', 'piano', 'harp', 'clarinet']

    grid2 = [
        ['flute', 'X', 'X', 'saxophone'],
        ['trumpet', 'violin', 'drum', 'guitar'],
        ['piano', 'X', 'clarinet', 'X'],
        ['X', 'cello', 'accordion', 'harp']
    ]
    start2, end2 = (0, 0), (3, 2)
    assert candidate(grid2, start2, end2) == []

    grid3 = [
        ['flute', 'violin', 'cello', 'saxophone'],
        ['X', 'X', 'X', 'guitar'],
        ['piano', 'X', 'bassoon', 'X'],
        ['X', 'clarinet', 'accordion', 'harp']
    ]
    start3, end3 = (0, 0), (0, 3)
    assert candidate(grid3, start3, end3) == ['flute', 'violin', 'cello', 'saxophone']

## Entry Point

`find_shortest_musical_path`

## Warnings

- Only 3 test cases found. Minimum recommended is 5.
- Solution failed correctness check.
- 4, Exception Handling Unspecified: The task description and problem do not address how to handle cases where the start or end coordinates might be out of the bounds of the grid dimensions. IndexError or other boundary-related errors can occur if error handling or checking is not implemented.
- 4, Inefficient example tests: The canonical solution utilizes a Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a mechanism to keep track of paths, which is inefficient concerning memory usage, especially for larger grids. Each path from start to current node is stored individually, which can be optimized.
- 5, Example missing varied grid sizes: All example tests provided are using a 4x4 grid. Including tests with varying grid sizes, especially larger grids and smaller grids (like 1x1 or 2x2), would better evaluate the function's robustness and efficiency across different scenarios and edge cases.
