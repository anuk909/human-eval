## Prompt

```python
def restaurant_ordering_system(orders):
    """
    In a magical world, you have a peculiar restaurant that serves a wide array of magical creatures. This restaurant specializes in dishes that can start with either a type of appetizer, main course, or dessert, and the creature orders based on a tri-level choice protocol implemented in a Binary Tree.

    Each creature's name and their three-level order preference (appetizer, main, dessert) are encoded in a series of strings (example: 'pixie_sushi_fairyD3_tiramisu'). The restaurant uses a queue system to manage and process orders in a manner that the order string is traversed based on levels of a Binary Tree (Appetizer -> Main Course -> Dessert).

    Your task:
    - Process incoming complete detailed orders using a queue.
    - Decode each order by traversing the corresponding levels of a binary tree to retrieve their string breakdown ('type_dish_level_specifics').
    - The breakdown of each order is interpreted using a Trie to allow retrieving the full specifics efficiently when required for each level.

    This will help the restaurant better manage the mystical creature orders in a time-efficient manner.

    Example:
    - Input: ['pixie_sushi_fairyD3_tiramisu', 'elf_burger_elfB1_cake']
    - Processed Output:  ['pixie: fairyD3 -> sushi -> tiramisu', 'elf: elfB1 -> burger -> cake']

    Note:
    - You may need to create supporting data structures like Binary Tree and Trie to decode and process the orders effectively.
    """
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a list of strings representing orders made by mystical creatures in a magical restaurant (formatted as 'creature_dish_level_dessert'), implement a restaurant ordering system that processes these orders by constructing a Binary Tree for sequence traversal (Appetizer -> Main -> Dessert) and a Trie for efficient order detail retrieval. The function should return a list of processed orders in the format 'creature: main_dish -> level -> dessert'.
```

## Warnings

- Only 4 test cases found. Minimum recommended is 5.
- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Inconsistency between Prompt and Canonical Solution: The prompt and canonical solution describe two different methods of processing and outputting the orders. The prompt suggests a tri-level choice utilizing a Binary Tree for traversal, whereas the canonical solution only involves a Trie and doesn't implement or use a Binary Tree. The expected format and processing sequence in the example given ('type: main -> level -> dessert') does not align with the described queuing and processing method.
- 5, Binary Tree Functionality Unused: The provided task description repeatedly mentions the use of a Binary Tree for level-based order processing, but the actual implementation (canonical solution) completely omits any form of Binary Tree construction, usage, or traversal. This represents a critical flaw as it deviates significantly from the task requirements.
- 4, Misleading Information on Output Order: The task prompt and the expected output format in the canonical solution seem to misalign regarding the order of details in the string. The example outputs in the prompt suggest a format of 'creature: level -> appetizer -> dessert', which directly contrasts the testing examples that display 'creature: appetizer -> level -> dessert'. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and incorrect implementations.

## Canonical Solution

```python
        class OrderTrieNode:
            def __init__(self):
                self.children = {}
                self.end_order = False
                self.order_details = None

        class OrderTrie:
            def __init__(self):
                self.root = OrderTrieNode()

            def insert(self, order_parts):
                current_node = self.root
                for part in order_parts:
                    if part not in current_node.children:
                        current_node.children[part] = OrderTrieNode()
                    current_node = current_node.children[part]
                current_node.end_order = True
                current_node.order_details = ' -> '.join(order_parts)

            def search(self, order_parts):
                current_node = self.root
                for part in order_parts:
                    if part not in current_node.children:
                        return None
                    current_node = current_node.children[part]
                return current_node.order_details if current_node.end_order else None

            for order in orders:

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    orders1 = ['pixie_sushi_fairyD3_tiramisu', 'elf_burger_elfB1_cake']
    result1 = ['pixie: sushi -> fairyD3 -> tiramisu', 'elf: burger -> elfB1 -> cake']
    assert candidate(orders1) == result1

    orders2 = ['gnome_pasta_gnomeG7_pudding', 'troll_steak_trollT2_pie']
    result2 = ['gnome: pasta -> gnomeG7 -> pudding', 'troll: steak -> trollT2 -> pie']
    assert candidate(orders2) == result2

    orders3 = []  # Empty scenario
    result3 = []
    assert candidate(orders3) == result3

    orders4 = ['fairy_risotto_fairyF2_cheesecake']
    result4 = ['fairy: risotto -> fairyF2 -> cheesecake']
    assert candidate(orders4) == result4
