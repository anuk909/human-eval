## Cover Story

['post-apocalyptic world', 'enchanted waterfall']

## Prompt

```python
def reconstruct_image(image_fragment_positions, water_destruction_mask, enchanted_waterfall_secrets):
    """
    In a post-apocalyptic world, an ancient and enchanted waterfall holds the secrets to the past. Among these secrets is an image represented in 2D space. Unfortunately, parts of the image have been destroyed by water and scattered across the land.

    Your task is to reconstruct the original image using the remaining image fragments. The 2D positions of these fragments have been compromised by the waterfall's mystic powers, represented by 'water_destruction_mask'. The enchanted waterfall also contains secrets that might help you in determining the correct assembly of the fragments. This is represented in 'enchanted_waterfall_secrets' which provides some hints as to the true positions and orientations of the fragments.

    Parameters:
     - image_fragment_positions: List of tuples (fragment_id, x, y) where 'fragment_id' is an integer for the fragment identifier, and 'x' and 'y' are coordinates.
     - water_destruction_mask: 2D list of integers (1 or 0), where 1 indicates an area affected by water that may have distorted fragment information. The size of this mask should cover the entire suspected original image area.
     - enchanted_waterfall_secrets: List of hints regarding the adjustment needed for fragment positions or orientations. Examples including rotation degrees or position corrections are provided below.

    The function should reconstruct the image into a 2D representation, using given and interpreted data, placing fragments in their corrected locations with appropriate orientations. The output should be a 2D list depicting the pixel matrix of the reconstructed image.

    Examples of enchanted_waterfall_secrets might include:
    - 'Rotate fragment_id 3 by 90 degrees'.
    - 'Fragment_id 44 is falsely reported at position (200, 300), correct is (150, 450)'.

    """

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def reconstruct_image(image_fragment_positions, water_destruction_mask, enchanted_waterfall_secrets):
    """
    Given image fragments scattered with some distortion indicated by water_destruction_mask and position hints encoded in enchanted_waterfall_secrets to reconstruct a 2D image. Return the reconstructed image.

    Parameters:
     - image_fragment_positions: List of tuples (fragment_id, x, y)
     - water_destruction_mask: 2D list (0 or 1)
     - enchanted_waterfall_secrets: List of hints regarding position corrections
    """

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 4, Ambiguities in Functional Requirements: The problem prompt lacks clear specifications on how the 'water_destruction_mask' relates to and interacts with the 'image_fragment_positions'. There's ambiguity in how these corrections are to be applied — e.g., how do masked values alter the perceived fragment positions or their interpretation? This deficiency can lead to varied implementations, all potentially correct within the poorly specified rules and logic of the task.
- 4, Vague Output Expectations: The problem statement does not specify the expected form or content of the 2D list representing the reconstructed image. Without specific guidelines on image resolution, fragment size integration, or how fragments should merge, participants might not understand exactly what the output should look like or how detailed and precise the reconstruction needs to be. This leads to uncertainty in both implementation and testing.
- 5, Inconsistency in Problem Complexity: The problem combines elements of graphical manipulation with mere translation or rotation of 2D fragments based on mystical hints, making the actual challenge unclear—whether it's meant to be more focused on image processing techniques or on logical puzzle-solving. This mix can mislead participants about the skill sets and tools they should focus on employing.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def reconstruct_image(image_fragment_positions, water_destruction_mask, enchanted_waterfall_secrets):
        # Step 1: Interpret enchanted_waterfall_secrets to understand needed adjustments
        secrets_dict = interpret_secrets(enchanted_waterfall_secrets)

        # Step 2: Apply water_destruction_mask corrections to the position of fragments
        corrected_positions = apply_water_corrections(image_fragment_positions, water_destruction_mask)

        # Step 3: Position and orient fragments based on secrets to start the reconstruction process
        reconstructed_image = start_reconstruction(corrected_positions, secrets_dict)

        # Step 4: Use computer vision and reconstruction algorithms to refine the assembled image.
        final_image = refine_reconstruction(reconstructed_image)
        return final_image
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert isinstance(candidate([(1, 150, 200), (2, 400, 500)], [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]], ['Rotate fragment_id 1 by 90 degrees']).[1][1], list) # Check that the output is a 2D list
    assert candidate([(3, 200, 250)], [[1]], ['Fragment_id 3 is falsely reported at position (200, 250), correct is (180, 240)']).[0][0] is not None
    assert type(candidate([(4, 300, 350), (5, 450, 550)], [[0, 0], [1, 0]], ['Swap fragment_id 4 with fragment_id 5'])) == list # Output structure check
    assert len(candidate([], [], [])) >= 0
    assert len(candidate([(6, 50, 60)], [[0]], [])) >= 0
