## Prompt

```python
def soccer_team_division(players):
    """
    The animals in the kingdom decided to have a soccer league. Given a list of animals where each animal is represented by a string that indicates its species and its skill level (e.g., 'rabbit_5', 'lion_10'), devise a function to split the animals into two teams such that:

    - Each team has the same cumulative skill level.
    - The missing numbers from the sequence of skill levels are excluded from consideration. E.g., if '3' and '6' are not present in the skill levels, players with these skill levels are not considered.
    - Each species can only appear in one team.

    Your function should return a list of two lists: the first list for team one, and the second list for the other. If it's impossible to partition the animals according to the given conditions, return an empty list.

    Example:
    Input: ['rabbit_5', 'hare_7', 'lion_10', 'tiger_9', 'fox_2']
    Output: [['rabbit_5', 'hare_7'], ['lion_10', 'tiger_9']] # because 2 is the missing number from 1-10

    Note:
    An intriguing aspect is that the problem combines the care of missing number handling, ensuring the sum partition is feasible, and distributing the unique species across two competitive teams.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def soccer_team_division(players):
    """
    Write a function to divide animals into two teams with conditions:
    1. Each team has the same cumulative skill level.
    2. The missing numbers from the skill levels are excluded from consideration.
    3. Each species can only appear in one team.

    Return a list of two lists: one for each team. If division isn't possible, return an empty list.
    Example
    Input: ['rabbit_5', 'hare_7', 'lion_10', 'tiger_9', 'fox_2']
    Output: [['rabbit_5', 'hare_7'],['lion_10', 'tiger_9']] because 2 is the missing number from 1-10.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Ambiguous Problem Specification: The problem statement indicates that players should only be considered if their skill levels create a contiguous range from 1 to some number n, excluding any missing numbers. However, it does not clearly establish how to handle scenarios where multiple contiguous ranges exist or where the highest-level numbers lead to ambiguous team splits, especially when constructing skill-balanced teams.
- 4, Constraint on Skill Level Continuity: The stipulation that 'missing numbers from the sequence of skill levels are excluded from consideration' can result in logical inconsistencies or unresolvable problems. If certain players' skill levels are missing in sequential order (e.g., skill levels are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 3 is missing, making player with skill level 3 invalid), determining valid sets becomes computationally complex or impossible, especially for larger datasets.
- 4, Species Uniqueness Across Teams: The rule that each species can only appear in one team adds a significant complication. This complexity, combined with skill-level matching, significantly increases computational challenges and can make it impossible to find a valid solution even when one may exist theoretically, if only based on skill levels.
- 5, Lack of Clear Definition for Input Size Limits: The problem does not outline bounds for the input size (number of players and range of skill levels). This lack of information can result in inefficiencies or failures when scaling to a large input size due to computational limits, especially with the complex calculations required as specified.
