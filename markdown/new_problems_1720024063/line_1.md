## Cover Story

['rocket', 'flying carpet']

## Prompt

```python
def optimal_navigation_plans(n, connections, rocket_routes, carpet_routes):
    """
    You are given a fantastic world with `n` cities numbered from 0 to n-1. These cities are connected by various one-way routes (directed edges). Furthermore, each city has two special travel options: a rocket route and a flying carpet route, which can instantly transport you to another city using magic.

    The task is to compute the minimum number of unique 'bitwise OR' operations performed on the city numbers you visit during the travel (including start and end cities), that allows you to navigate from city 0 to city n-1 using any combination of normal routes, rocket routes, and carpet routes. If it's not possible to travel from city 0 to city n-1, return -1.

    Parameters:
    - n: an integer representing the total number of cities (2 <= n <= 100)
    - connections: a list of tuples (u, v) representing a directed edge from city u to city v.
    - rocket_routes: a list of integers representing, for each city i, the destination city rocket can take you to instantly.
    - carpet_routes: a list of integers representing, for each city i, the destination city carpet can take you to instantly.

    Example:
    Input: n = 4, connections = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)], rocket_routes = [1, 2, 3, 0], carpet_routes = [2, 3, 0, 1]
    Output: 1 (Direct traversal via city numbers 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 results in bitwise OR operations that always give 3 (111 in binary), so 1 unique operation.)
    """
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
You need to determine the minimum number of unique 'bitwise OR' operations required to travel from city 0 to city n-1 in a network of cities using various means including direct routes, rockets, and carpets. The connections, rocket routes, and carpet routes for the cities are provided. If no such path exists, return -1.

Example usage: optimal_navigation_plans(4, [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)], [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 3, 0, 1]) returns 1.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Unclear Objective: The problem statement aims to minimize 'bitwise OR' operations, but the requirement is to count the minimum number of unique 'bitwise OR' results. This critical aspect could confuse participants as typically minimizing operations would refer to minimizing the times an operation is executed, not the uniqueness of its outcomes.
- 4, Ambiguity in Transportation Definition: The role of rocket_routes and carpet_routes is not consistently logical or practical in the given examples. The example implies any city can be directly reached from any other by these routes, creating an unusual and unclear graph traversal scenario where traditional pathfinding logic may not apply as directly or simply.

## Canonical Solution

```python
from collections import deque

def optimal_navigation_plans(n, connections, rocket_routes, carpet_routes):
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(n)}
    for u, v in connections:
        graph[u].append(v)

    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([(start, 0)])
        visited = set()

        while queue:
            current, or_value = queue.popleft()
            if current == n - 1:
                return or_value

            next_or = or_value | current
            if current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                for neighbor in graph[current]:
                    queue.append((neighbor, next_or))
                rocket_target = rocket_routes[current]
                carpet_target = carpet_routes[current]
                queue.append((rocket_target, next_or))
                queue.append((carpet_target, next_or))

        return -1

    return bfs(0)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate(4, [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)], [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 3, 0, 1]) == 1
    assert candidate(5, [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3)], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [3, 4, 0, 1, 2]) == 0
    assert candidate(3, [(0, 1)], [2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1]) == -1
    assert candidate(4, [(0, 1), (1, 2)], [3, 3, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1, 3]) == 1
    assert candidate(6, [(0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5)], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 0], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2]) == 1
