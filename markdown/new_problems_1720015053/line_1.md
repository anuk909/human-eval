# Task ID: hard/5

## Topics

["McCreight's Algorithm", "Manacher's Algorithm"]

## Cover Story

['haunted house', 'cyberpunk']

## Prompt

```python
def haunted_pads(message, text):
    """
    In a cyberpunk world filled with haunted houses, every haunted house has a unique signature called 'message', a string that also works as a magical incantation. These messages have the particularity of containing hidden palindrome sequences which can power up gadgets when processed correctly. However, the real challenge arises when trying to match these sequences to encrypted texts written in cyber-graffiti on the walls, known as 'text'.

    Your task is to leverage McCreight's Algorithm to preprocess the message for efficient search and Manacher's Algorithm to find all unique longest palindromic substrings within the 'message'. Then, determine how many times these substrings appear as exact subsequences in the 'text'.

    The function should return the total count of appearances of all longest palindromic substrings found in 'message' as subsequences in 'text'.

    Note:
    - If no palindromic substrings are found in 'message', return 0.
    - The 'message' and 'text' are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase letters.
    - Consider time/space complexity for handling large inputs.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that preprocesses a message using McCreight's Algorithm for efficient search and identifies all unique longest palindromic substrings using Manacher's Algorithm. The function should then count how many times these palindromic substrings appear as subsequences in a given 'text' and return the total count.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def longest_palindromic_substring(s):
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0:
            return ""
        if n == 1:
            return s
        longest = ""
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + len(longest), n):
                if s[i:j+1] == s[i:j+1][::-1]:
                    longest = s[i:j+1]
        return longest

    def count_subseq(target, source):
        dp = [0] * (len(target) + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for c in source:
            for j in range(len(target), 0, -1):
                if c == target[j-1]:
                    dp[j] += dp[j-1]
        return dp[-1]

    palindromes = set()
    for start in range(len(message)):
        for end in range(start, len(message)):
            subs = message[start:end+1]
            if subs == subs[::-1]:
                palindromes.add(subs)
    count = 0
    for pal in palindromes:
        count += count_subseq(pal, text)
    return count
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate("abracadabra", "cadabraabracadabra") == 4
    assert candidate("racecar", "racecar") == 2
    assert candidate("stepontoes", "ontoesstepontoes") == 2
    assert candidate("level", "highlevelhigh") == 2
    assert candidate("refer", "referenceinrefer") == 3
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Requirement Mismatch: The problem prompt and the canonical solution do not align with the problem's description of leveraging specific algorithms (McCreight's and Manacher's). The given solution uses brute force to find palindromes and count subsequences rather than the specified efficient algorithms.
- 4, Algorithm Misuse: The problem specifically asks for the usage of Manacher's Algorithm to find the longest palindromic substrings. However, the canonical solution finds these substrings through a straightforward check of all possible substrings, which is inefficient.
