## Prompt

```python
def castle_and_carnival_view(points, lists_of_sorted_lists):
    """
    In a realm where the majesty of medieval castles is lightened by the cosmic showers of falling stars, you have two major tasks involving data about star energies and optimal visual viewing points. Implement a function with two specific tasks:
    1. Merge all the k sorted lists of star energies into a single sorted list. Each list is already sorted, and your merged result should maintain proper order across all elements. Return this merged list.
    2. Given an array of tuples representing points with properties of 'brightness' and 'clarity', return the top three distinct points which provide the most outstanding views. Points should be sorted primarily by 'brightness' and secondary by 'clarity' for resolving ties. Each tuple format is (brightness, clarity).

    Examples:
    points = [(10, 5), (15, 15), (20, 10), (25, 5), (10, 20)]
    lists_of_sorted_lists = [[4,5,6], [1,2], [6,10]]
    Output should be:
    Merged List: [1,2,4,5,6,6,10]
    Top 3 Points: [(25, 5), (20, 10), (15, 15)]

    Note that the function should handle cases such as empty input lists or where fewer than three distinct points are provided, by returning appropriate empty list structures or the available points.
    """
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Implement a function to merge multiple sorted lists into a single sorted list and to return the top 3 distinct points based on brightness and clarity from an array of tuples.

## Canonical Solution

```python
def castle_and_carnival_view(points, lists_of_sorted_lists):
        from heapq import heappush, heappop
        def merge_k_sorted_lists(lists):
            min_heap = []
            for sorted_list in lists:
                for element in sorted_list:
                    heappush(min_heap, element)
            merged_list = []
            while min_heap:
                merged_list.append(heappop(min_heap))
            return merged_list

        def top_3_points(points):
            unique_points = set(points)
            sorted_points = sorted(unique_points, key=lambda x: (-x[0], -x[1]))
            return sorted_points[:3]

        merged_list = merge_k_sorted_lists(lists_of_sorted_lists)
        top_points = top_3_points(points)
        return merged_list, top_points
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(10, 5), (15, 15), (20, 10), (10, 5), (25, 5)], [[4,5,6], [1,2], [6,10]]) == ([1,2,4,5,6,6,10], [(25, 5), (20, 10), (15, 15)])
    assert candidate([(5, 25), (10, 5), (15, 15), (20, 10), (25, 25)], [[5,9], [2,3,8], [11]]) == ([2,3,5,8,9,11], [(25, 25), (20, 10), (15, 15)])
    assert candidate([(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)], [[1], [2], [3]]) == ([1,2,3], [(3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 1)])
    assert candidate([(30, 10), (20, 15), (30, 10)], [[7], [10,11], []]) == ([7,10,11], [(30, 10), (20, 15)])
    assert candidate([], []) == ([], [])
