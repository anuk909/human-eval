## Topics

Rope Data Structure, Boruvka's Algorithm

## Cover Story

['mischievous fairies', 'cloning device']

## Prompt

```python
def reconstruct_forest(stolen_segments, operations):
    """
    In the enchanted forest, fairies have a mischievous behavior of cloning trees using their magical device. Each tree is represented by a collection of vertical segments (ropes) in a 2D plane.

    Unfortunately, a group of fairies stole some segments and went away to clone them. The forest manager needs help to reconstruct a possible configuration of the forest by connecting these ropes using the minimum number of operations.

    The 'stolen_segments' are a list of tuples where each tuple (x, y1, y2) represents a vertical segment starting at y1 and ending at y2 at x coordinate. 'operations' represent potential connections between the end of one segment and the start of another, modeled as a list of tuples (cost, (segment1, segment2)). The cost represents the energy required to connect the two segments end-to-start.

    Your task is to help the manager reconnect these pieces in a way that minimizes the total energy using a modified Boruvka's Algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree.

    Constraints:
    - Segments will always have distinct x coordinates and will not overlap vertically.
    - Each element in operations will have a unique cost.

    Output should be the minimum total energy used.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Define a function that takes a list of vertical segments and a list of connection operations. Each operation connects two segments with an associated cost. Use Boruvka's Algorithm to compute the minimal cost to connect all segments into a single structure. Segments are represented as tuples (x, y1, y2) and do not overlap vertically or share x coordinates. Operations are represented as tuples of cost and segment pair indices.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def find(parent, i):
        if parent[i] == i:
            return i
        else:
            return find(parent, parent[i])

    def union(parent, rank, x, y):
        xroot = find(parent, x)
        yroot = find(parent, y)

        if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:
            parent[xroot] = yroot
        elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:
            parent[yroot] = xroot
        else :
            parent[yroot] = xroot
            rank[xroot] += 1

    n = len(stolen_segments)
    parent = list(range(n))
    rank = [0] * n

    operations.sort()
    result = 0
    e = 0
    while e < n-1:
        cost, (segment1, segment2) = operations.pop(0)
        x = find(parent, segment1)
        y = find(parent, segment2)

        if x != y:
            result += cost
            e += 1
            union(parent, rank, x, y)

    return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(1, 0, 5), (2, 6, 10), (3, 11, 15)], [(1, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 2))]) == 3
    assert candidate([(1, 0, 2), (2, 3, 5), (3, 6, 8)], [(1, (0, 1)), (10, (1, 2)), (5, (0, 2))]) == 6
    assert candidate([(1, 0, 1), (2, 2, 3)], [(3, (0, 1))]) == 3
    assert candidate([(1, 0, 1), (2, 3, 4), (3, 5, 6), (4, 7, 8)], [(2, (0, 1)), (2, (2, 3)), (5, (1, 2))]) == 4
    assert candidate([(1, 0, 4), (2, 5, 9), (3, 10, 14), (4, 15, 19)], [(3, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (1, (2, 3))]) == 6
    assert candidate([(1, 0, 3), (2, 4, 7)], [(5, (0, 1))]) == 5
