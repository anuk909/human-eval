## Prompt

```python
def optimal_path_schedule(events):
    """
    Imagine a new, highly automated shopping mall connected by an underground train system to different residential sectors. The mall management needs to tackle the challenge of organizing automatic event schedules for promotional events in the mall stations, in a way that the events do not clash with each other due to visitor or commuter flow.

    Each station has events scheduled, and each event has dependencies which mean that some events must occur before others due to logistics and the sequence of setups. Your task is to simulate this scenario and provide the order in which these events should be scheduled using a topological sort.

    The input 'events' is a list of (int, [int]) tuples that represent each event and its dependencies. The first element of the tuple is the event id, and the second element is a list of event ids that must happen before this event.

    Return a list of event ids in a valid order so that for every event, all its dependencies have occurred before it, if possible. If there is no possible valid order, return an empty list.

    Example:
    Input: events = [(1, []), (2, [1]), (3, [2]), (4, [2]), (5, [1, 3])]
    Output should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] or [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] representing an order where dependencies are respected.

    Note:
    - Implement a robust solution considering events might increase in number.
    - Consider the computational and memory limitations when scaling up the number of events.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a list of events where each event has other event dependencies for scheduling, write a function that returns an ordering of these events that respects their dependencies using topological sort. If no such ordering is possible due to cyclical or unresolved dependencies, return an empty list. Each event is identified by a unique integer ID.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Ambiguous Functionality Description: The problem statement should clarify if each event ID in the list of dependencies of an event is unique or if duplicates are allowed. This affects how the topological sort treats these dependencies and can impact the resulting sort order.
- 4, Input Specification Issue: The problem does not specify whether all events mentioned in dependencies are guaranteed to be in the main event list. This is crucial to determining the size and integrity of the directed graph used in topological sorting.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    from collections import deque, defaultdict

    def optimal_path_schedule(events):
        adj_list = defaultdict(list)
        indegree = defaultdict(int)
        for event, deps in events:
            for dep in deps:
                adj_list[dep].append(event)
                indegree[event] += 1

        # using Kahn's algorithm for topological sort
        queue = deque([v for v in indegree if indegree[v] == 0])
        top_order = []

        while queue:
            vertex = queue.popleft()
            top_order.append(vertex)
            for neighbor in adj_list[vertex]:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        if len(top_order) == len(events):
            return top_order
        return []
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(1, []), (2, [1]), (3, [2]), (4, [2]), (5, [1, 3])]) in [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]]
    assert candidate([]) == []
    assert candidate([(1, []), (2, [1]), (3, [1, 2])]) == [1, 2, 3]
    assert candidate([(1, [2]), (2, [1])]) == []  # Circular dependency
    assert candidate([(1, []), (2, [3]), (3, [1]), (4, [3]), (5, [2, 4])]) == []  # Insufficient resolution for valid ordering
```
