## Cover Story

['future city', 'time travel']

## Prompt

```python
def future_city_events(inputs):
    """
    In the futuristic city of Chronopolis, there are critical events (represented as integers) that can happen over time, with some events dependent on the occurrence of previous ones. Your task is to determine the number of valid orders of these events in which they can occur, constrained by certain pairs of events that must not happen consecutively.

    You are given an array 'inputs' where the first element is a list of integers representing events and the second element is an array of pairs (tuples) where each pair (a, b) indicates that events 'a' and 'b' cannot happen consecutively.

    Your function should implement an efficient strategy (Hint: Merge Sort based operations for counting while adhering to Game Theory to optimize orderings) to calculate the total number of valid event orders.

    Example:
    If inputs = [[1, 2, 3], [(1, 2), (2, 3)]]
    The output should be 1. Here only one valid order exists: [1, 3, 2] or [3, 1, 2] as neither 1 can directly follow or precede 2 nor can 2 follow or precede 3.

    Note:
    - The list of events will always have at least one element.
    - The list of forbidden pairs may be empty, in which case all permutations are valid.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
def future_city_events(inputs):
    """
    Given a list of events and pairs of events that cannot be consecutive, calculate the total number of valid sequences of event occurrences.

    Args:
    inputs (list): The first element is a list of integers (events), and the second element is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) denotes that event 'a' cannot be followed by event 'b' (and vice-versa).

    Returns:
    int: Total number of valid sequences.
    """

```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 4, Mismatching problem description and solution complexity: The task description suggests a relatively complex approach involving "Merge Sort based operations" and "Game Theory" without detailing how these are hypothetically applied to generating valid event orderings. This level of complexity may not be necessary and the provided canonical solution does not appear to strictly follow the hinted approaches, leading to potential confusion or mismatches in expected solution strategies.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def count_valid_orders(events, constraints):
        def is_valid_sequence(sequence):
            for i in range(len(sequence) - 1):
                if (sequence[i], sequence[i+1]) in constraints_set or (sequence[i+1], sequence[i]) in constraints_set:
                    return False
            return True

        def merge_count(arr):
            if len(arr) < 2:
                return arr, 1
            mid = len(arr) // 2
            left_sorted, left_count = merge_count(arr[:mid])
            right_sorted, right_count = merge_count(arr[mid:])

            sorted_arr = []
            i = j = 0
            total_count = left_count * right_count

            while i < len(left_sorted) and j < len(right_sorted):
                if is_valid_sequence([left_sorted[i], right_sorted[j]]):
                    sorted_arr.append(left_sorted[i])
                    i += 1
                else:
                    sorted_arr.append(right_sorted[j])
                    j += 1

            sorted_arr.extend(left_sorted[i:])
            sorted_arr.extend(right_sorted[j:])
            return sorted_arr, total_count

        constraints_set = set(constraints)
        _, total_orders = merge_count(events)
        return total_orders
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([[2, 3, 4], [(2, 4)]] == 5)
    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], []]) == 6
    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3], [(1, 2), (2, 3)]]) == 1
    assert candidate([[1, 2, 3, 4], [(1, 2), (2, 4)]] == 11)
    assert candidate([[1], []]) == 1
    assert candidate([[5, 3, 9, 6], [(9, 6)]]) == 20
