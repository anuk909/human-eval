## Cover Story

['haunted house', 'enchanted mirror']

## Prompt

```python
def decode_enchanted_mirror_instructions(instructions):
    """
    Inside a haunted house, there's an enchanted mirror that only accepts a string of commands that match a particular pattern.
    The commands are encoded as a string composed of digits from '1' to '9', each mapping uniquely to one of the behaviors the mirror can manifest.

    The mapping from digits to behaviors is:
    '1' -> 'Open', '2' -> 'Close', '3' -> 'Lock', '4' -> 'Unlock', '5' -> 'Smile',
    '6' -> 'Frown', '7' -> 'Glow', '8' -> 'Dim', '9' -> 'Fog up'

    The enchanted mirror will only activate if the sequence of commands can decode to a series of actions which alternate exactly between "manipulate state" (including Open, Close, Lock, Unlock) and "alter appearance" (including Smile, Frown, Glow, Dim, Fog up).

    The additional twist involves the capability of 'double-digit' commands, where patterns like '34' could be interpreted as 'Lock' followed by 'Unlock', or as 'Unlock' (a hypothetical behavior mapped by '34').
    For simplicity, we'll assume no '10'-'99' mappings are valid except those which directly follow a pattern in the basic one-digit set.

    The function should return the number of ways to decode the string such that the resultant behaviors alternate correctly between the two types.

    Example:
    - If instructions = '151', the decoded behaviors could be: ['Smile', 'Open'] or ['Smile', 'Frown', 'Open'], but only the first follows the correct alternation. Thus, the result would be 1.

    - If instructions = '3482', potential decodings are: ['Lock', 'Unlock', 'Dim'] and ['Unlock', 'Dim'], both of which correctly alternate, hence the result should be 2.

    Note:
    - If no valid interpretation exists that fits the alternation, return 0.

    """
```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Write a function that takes a string of numbers representing commands and maps it to behaviors (specifically alternating between state manipulation and appearance alteration). The function should return the number of valid ways to decode the string according to the provided mappings, considering both single-digit and certain double-digit combinations. Each decoded sequence must strictly alternate between the two types of behaviors.
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Ambiguity in double-digit mapping: The prompt mentions the possible use of 'double-digit' commands but does not provide clear mapping details for two-digit combinations other than those that follow a pattern in the basic one-digit set. This presents a significant issue as it leaves the behavior for double-digit commands (except those implied like '34' described) undefined, potentially leading to multiple interpretations or errors in implementing the solution.
- 5, Alternation rule clarity: The requirement that the sequence must alternate between "manipulate state" and "alter appearance" behaviors is clear, but the prompt does not specify what should happen if a valid double-digit command breaks this alternation. It is unclear whether such sequences should be considered invalid or if there's an implicit rule that must be deduced by the implementer.
- 4, Test case coverage: The test cases provided might not adequately check all edge cases, especially around boundaries of behaviors like sequences that do not allow for any alternation, single-digit versus double-digit boundary conditions, or consecutive identical digits (e.g., '777' or '33'). This may result in incomplete validation of the solution's correctness.

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def is_manipulate_state(behavior):
        return behavior in ['Open', 'Close', 'Lock', 'Unlock']

    def is_alter_appearance(behavior):
        return behavior in ['Smile', 'Frown', 'Glow', 'Dim', 'Fog up']

    behavior_map = {
        '1': 'Open', '2': 'Close', '3': 'Lock', '4': 'Unlock', '5': 'Smile',
        '6': 'Frown', '7': 'Glow', '8': 'Dim', '9': 'Fog up'
    }

    def decode(s, index, last_type, memo):
        if index == len(s):
            return 1
        if index in memo:
            return memo[index]

        total = 0
        for length in [1, 2]:
            if index + length <= len(s):
                substring = s[index : index + length]
                if substring in behavior_map:
                    current_behavior = behavior_map[substring]
                    current_type = 'manipulate' if is_manipulate_state(current_behavior) else 'alter'
                    if last_type != current_type:
                        total += decode(s, index + length, current_type, memo)

        memo[index] = total
        return total

    return decode(instructions, 0, None, {})
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate('151') == 1
    assert candidate('3482') == 2
    assert candidate('926') == 0
    assert candidate('569141') == 2
    assert candidate('99181') == 1
    assert candidate('123459') == 4
