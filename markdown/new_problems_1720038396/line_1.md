## Prompt

```python
def foggy_dungeon_analysis(dungeon_map):
    """
    In the adventurous land of Codexia, explorers face a magic dungeon covered with a mysterious fog. Each room in the dungeon contains a rune that can be deciphered to find out the safety level. The map of the dungeon is given as a list of integers where each integer represents the rune code of each room.

    The room codes are unique but when combined sequentially in certain patterns, the hashing function causes them to lose their uniqueness. The hash function on any subarray [x1, x2, ... xk] is defined as min(x1, x2, ..., xk), representing the lowest rune code in the subarray.

    Your task is to count how many unique minimum values appear across all subarrays (continuous segments of the array). Implement a solution using the concept of a Monotonic Stack for efficient computation, as the number of possible subarrays can be large.

    Example:
    Input: [5, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1, 5]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Unique minimum values from subarrays are: [5], [3], [6], [1], [1, 5], [5] with distinct hashes as 5, 3, 6, and 1 respectively.

    Note:
    - Subarrays should be considered only where their hash results in a unique minimum value.
    - The size of the input list can go up to 10,000 entries.

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a list of integers where each integer represents a room's rune code, determine the number of subarrays that, when hashed, result in unique values. The hash function is defined as the minimum value in each subset of the list and these hashed values must be unique across all subsets considered.

Use the concept of a Monotonic Stack to efficiently calculate the result and count only subarrays where the minimum resulting from the hash is unique.

Examples with inputs and expected outputs are provided to help understand the requirements and constraints of the problem.

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Incorrect or Incomplete Canonical Solution: The provided canonical solution appears to track uniqueness based solely on values seen and not on specific subarrays, nor does it implement a proper check for unique subarrays regarding their hashed minimal value across different positions and lengths. Hence, the solution could incorrectly count or miss counts, affecting the reliability of the provided algorithm.
- 5, Inconsistent Explanation in Example Output: The explanation in the example states that subarrays with unique minimums include [1, 5], which contradicts the definition given that it says to consider subarrays where their hash (minimum value) results in a unique minimum value. The subarrays are distinct, but their minimum values are not, causing confusion in understanding the problem requirements.
- 4, Efficiency Concern Not Addressed in Solution: Although the problem hints at the need for optimizing the solution due to potentially large input sizes, the canonical solution does not utilize monotonic stacks efficiently as intended for optimization. The optimization technique described in the problem (monotonic stack) isn't correctly implemented or detailed, which could result in inefficient performance for near-limit input sizes.
- 4, Ambiguity in Definition of Unique Minimum Values: The problem lacks clear definition on what constitutes a unique minimum value across subarrays. It is not explicitly stated whether each value should be counted only once across all subarrays or just within each consideration, leading to potential misinterpretation and incorrect implementation.
- 4, Test Case Gaps: The provided test cases are not comprehensive enough to cover edge cases such as large arrays with repeated numbers, arrays where the minimum is located at boundary edges or the middle of the array, and arrays with all identical numbers, each leading to unique handling scenarios based on the hashing specification.

## Canonical Solution

```python
def foggy_dungeon_analysis(dungeon_map):
    unique_mins_set = set()
    results = set()
    for i in range(len(dungeon_map)):
        current_min = float('inf')
        for j in range(i, len(dungeon_map)):
            current_min = min(current_min, dungeon_map[j])
            results.add(current_min)
    return len(results)
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([5, 3, 6, 1, 3, 1, 5]) == 6
    assert candidate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 5
    assert candidate([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 5
    assert candidate([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) == 1
    assert candidate([2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]) == 5
    assert candidate([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 10]) == 7
    assert candidate([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10000]) == 2
    assert candidate([10000] * 10000) == 1  # large inputs with all identical numbers
    assert candidate([i % 5000 for i in range(10000)]) == 5000  # large array with repeated numbers every 5000 positions
