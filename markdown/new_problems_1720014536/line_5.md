## Prompt

```python
def enchanted_merge_sort(b_tree_values):
    """
    An archaeological team has stumbled upon an enchanted laboratory containing numerous ancient artefacts labeled with values.
    These values are arranged in an enchanted B-Tree. Your task as the team's head coder is to collect these values in a list and perform a classic merge sort on them.
    The twist: the sorting should preserve a property where the sum of any two adjacent values in the sorted list should never be a power of two.

    Given a B-Tree, return the values in a list sorted according to the rules above, or return False if no such arrangement can exist.

    For example, if after getting values from the B-Tree, the sorted list could be [2, 3, 5, 10] or [10, 5, 3, 2], since neighboring sums [5, 8, 15] or [15, 8, 5] are not powers of two.
    But [2, 3, 10, 5] would return False as 3 + 10 = 13, which is not a power of two, but 10 + 5 = 15, also not a power of two, fail to provide a valid arrangement for all.

    Note: The B-tree retrieval is not the focus, assume helper functions are provided to retrieve values in sorted order.

    Constraints:
    - Values in the B-Tree will be unique positive integers.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Given a B-Tree represented as a list of unique positive integers, return these values sorted according to a custom rule:
    The sum of any two adjacent values in the sorted list should not be a power of two. Return the sorted list if such an arrangement is possible; otherwise, return False.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
    def is_power_of_two(x):
        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x > 0

    def merge_sort(arr):
        if len(arr) < 2:
            return arr
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
        right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
        return merge(left, right)

    def merge(left, right):
        result = []
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                result.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                result.append(right[j])
                j += 1
        result.extend(left[i:])
        result.extend(right[j:])
        return result

    def check_adjacent_no_power_of_two(arr):
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if is_power_of_two(arr[i] + arr[i+1]):
                return False
        return True

    sorted_vals = merge_sort(b_tree_values)
    if check_adjacent_no_power_of_two(sorted_vals):
        return sorted_vals
    return False
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([2, 3, 5, 10]) in [[2, 3, 5, 10], [10, 5, 3, 2]]
    assert candidate([5, 9, 16]) == False # 9 + 16 = 25, 5 + 16 = 21 - but no valid ordering exists
    assert candidate([17, 14, 6, 23]) == False # no valid ordering
    assert candidate([8, 2, 18, 32]) in [[2, 18, 8, 32], [32, 8, 18, 2]] # 20, 26, 40 are not powers of two
    assert candidate([1, 31, 7]) in [[1, 7, 31], [31, 7, 1]] # 8 and 38 are not powers of two
```

## Entry Point

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Inconsistent Output: The problem definition and examples imply that there can be multiple correct answers (e.g., two valid sorted lists), but the canonical solution and tests sometimes expect a unique output (using 'in' for multiple options). This inconsistency could lead to ambiguous results and potential errors during evaluation.
- 5, Invalid Algorithm Logic: The canonical solution attempts to sort the array first using a straightforward merge sort and then checks if any adjacent sum is a power of two. However, it doesn't attempt to reorder or find a valid permutation post sorting if the sorted list is not valid according to the given conditions, but immediately returns False. This is often not ideal, as there may exist valid configurations that are not explored by the algorithm.
- 4, Unclear Constraints: The problem does not clearly specify the limits on the size of the B-tree or the range of integer values it might contain. Without this information, it's unclear how to effectively manage the performance of the solution, especially considering the complexity of checking every possible permutation in case the immediate sorted list is invalid.
- 5, Test Cases Issue: The test cases provided do not cover scenarios where the list size is less than two, edge cases at the minimum and maximum integer values, or lists where there might be valid multiple configurations. These tests are crucial to ensure that the solution is robust and performs correctly across all potential inputs.
