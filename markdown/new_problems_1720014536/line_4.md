## Topics

["Tarjan's Algorithm", 'Floyd-Warshall Algorithm']

## Cover Story

['wise old tree', 'music']

## Prompt

```python
def tree_music_sessions(paths, sessions):
    """
    In a mythical forest, there is a wise old tree named Eldergrove. Eldergrove loves bonding with the forest's creatures through music. Around Eldergrove, there are various meeting spots connected by pathways in a somewhat cyclical pattern. Occasionally, Eldergrove conducts music sessions at these spots, and creatures from all around the forest attend. However, not all pathways are available all the time due to seasonal changes.

    You are given a list of bidirectional paths connecting meeting spots, represented by tuples in the form `(start, end, available)`, where `start` and `end` are IDs of meeting spots and `available` is a boolean indicating if that path is usable. Additionally, you are provided with a list of music sessions denoted by tuples `(spot_id, require_availability)` where `spot_id` is the meeting spot ID, and `require_availability` is a list of other spots that must be accessible from `spot_id` for the session to proceed.

    Implement a function that determines which music sessions can proceed. Use Tarjan's Algorithm to find strongly connected components to determine reachability of required spots, then use Floyd-Warshall to calculate the shortest path to ensure all required spots are accessible if the paths are available.

    The function should return a list of boolean values corresponding to the input list of sessions, where `True` indicates the session can proceed and `False` otherwise.
    """

```

## Cleaned Prompt

```python
Implement a function that takes a list of bidirectional paths and a list of music sessions, and determines which music sessions can proceed. Paths are tuples (start, end, available) and sessions are tuples (spot_id, require_availability). Use Tarjan's Algorithm for finding connected components and then Floyd-Warshall for shortest path. Return a list of booleans indicating the viability of each session.
```

## Canonical Solution

```python
def tree_music_sessions(paths, sessions):
    from collections import defaultdict

    def floyd_warshall(n, graph):
        dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            dist[i][i] = 0
        for u, v in graph.items():
            for w in v:
                dist[u][w] = 1

        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

        return dist

    n = max(max(start, end) for start, end, _ in paths) + 1
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for start, end, available in paths:
        if available:
            graph[start].append(end)
            graph[end].append(start)

    reachability = floyd_warshall(n, graph)

    result = []
    for spot_id, require_availability in sessions:
        if all(reachability[spot_id][req] < float('inf') for req in require_availability):
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)

    return result
```

## Test Cases

```python
def check(candidate):
    assert candidate([(1, 2, True), (2, 3, True), (3, 4, True), (4, 1, True)], [(1, [2, 3])]) == [True]
    assert candidate([(1, 2, True), (2, 3, True), (1, 3, False)], [(3, [1])]) == [False]
    assert candidate([(1, 2, False), (2, 3, False), (3, 4, False), (4, 1, False)], [(1, [2, 3, 4])]) == [False]
    assert candidate([(1, 2, True), (2, 3, True), (3, 1, True)], [(1, [])]) == [True]
    assert candidate([(1, 2, True), (2, 3, False), (3, 4, True), (4, 2, True)], [(2, [3, 4])]) == [False]
```

## Warnings

- Solution failed correctness check.
- 5, Mismatched algorithms: The prompt suggests using Tarjan's Algorithm to find strongly connected components and Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths to assess the accessibility of the required spots. However, no implementation of Tarjan's Algorithm is present in the provided solution. Instead, it solely relies on Floyd-Warshall for reachability, which does not necessarily ensure strong connectivity or deal with directionality and unavailability issues appropriately for the described problem. This mismatch leads to potentially incorrect outputs or inefficiency.
