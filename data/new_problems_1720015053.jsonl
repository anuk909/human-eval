{"task_id": "hard/2", "prompt": "def optimal_weather_pattern(deltas, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    In a mystic monastery located atop a secluded mountain, monks have developed a weather machine that can alter the temperature of the surrounding area. The monastery is laid out in a linear fashion with 'k' weather stations positioned strategically. Connected by ley lines, they are meant to minimize the temperature variations across the stations when activated simultaneously.\n\n    The machine operates by a series of 'n' potential temperature adjustments (deltas) that may be applied sequentially to these stations. Each delta represents a possible change (increase or decrease) in temperature. For safety and effectiveness, only a contiguous subarray of these deltas of size exactly 'k' can be used at any one operation.\n\n    However, the ley lines work in such a way that activating the weather machines according to the selected deltas can create temperature imbalances unless selected optimally. The goal is to choose the contiguous subarray of changes that minimizes the maximum variation in temperature (calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures) when applied across the stations.\n\n    For example, if deltas = [1, -3, 2, -4, 3, 5] and k = 3, applying the subarray [-3, 2, -4] would yield differences of [-3, 2, -4] with a maximum variation of 6 (from -4 to 2).
