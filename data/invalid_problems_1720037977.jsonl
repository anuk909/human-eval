The house is represented by a 2D grid (house_map), where each cell can either be an open area (0), a wall (1), or have a plant represented by positive integers greater than 1 (indicating the plant's age).\n\n    Over the given number of days, you should:\n    - Age each plant by 1 year daily.\n    - Calculate the influence of each plant on its nearby cells using Manhattan distance. Influence does not extend through walls. The influence at any open cell is the sum of the ages of all plants impacting that cell following the layout constraints.\n    - For each open area, compute the likelihood of a supernatural event being neutralized, which is calculated as 1 - exp(-influence at that cell).\n\n    Return the expected average reduction in supernatural events across all open cells after the specified number of days.\n\n    Example:\n        house_map = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\n        plant_positions = [(0, 2), (2, 0)]\n        days = 2\n        Manage plants over two days and determine event reduction likelihoods in open spaces.\n\n    Note:\n    - Properly manage plants and their growing influences in the presence of walls.\n    - Calculations should accurately use the formula for the probability of event neutralization.\n    \"\"\"", "extra_info": {"cover_story_words": ["living plants", "haunted house"], "topics": ["Network Flow", "Probability and Statistics"], "cleaned_prompt": "You are tasked with managing supernatural activities in a haunted house using the influence of living plants.
