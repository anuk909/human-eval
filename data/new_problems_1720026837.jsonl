{"task_id": "hard/2", "prompt": "def enchanted_marketplace_gemstone_sort(orders, mine_output):\n    \"\"\"\n    In the realm of Algaroth, there's an enchanted marketplace where wizards trade exquisite gemstones from a deep, magical mine. Unfortunately, the enchanted mine produces a unique gemstone array every day, which sometimes includes duplicate types. The marketplace's daily functioning heavily relies on streamlining the gemstone types for its magical artifacts.\n\n    You are provided two lists:\n    - 'orders' which contains orders placed by wizards for gemstones, each one described by a single number representing a gemstone type. The list may have duplicates due to multiple wizards ordering the same type of gemstones.\n    - 'mine_output', the output from the gemstone mine, which contains multiple gemstones represented by numbers. This list can include duplicates since the mining is enchanted.\n\n    Your task is to perform two main operations:\n    1. Find the most frequently occurring gemstone in the 'orders' list and return its type.\n    2. Sort the 'mine_output' array using Radix Sort and return the sorted array.\n\n    Before implementing Radix Sort on 'mine_output', remove any duplicates within 'mine_output' to represent unique gemstone types found during mining.\n\n    The function should return a tuple in the form:\n    (most_frequent_gemstone_type, sorted_unique_mine_output)\n\n    Example:\n    If orders = [4, 2, 5, 2, 6, 2, 5] and mine_output = [5, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5],\n    your function should return (2, [2, 3, 5]).\n\n    Note: It's guaranteed that there will always be one unique most frequently occurring gemstone in the 'orders'.\n    \"\"\"\n", "canonical_solution": "    def most_frequent_element(arr):\n        frequency = {}\n        max_count = -1\n        most_frequent = None\n        for num in arr:\n            if num in frequency:\n                frequency[num] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[num] = 1\n            if frequency[num] > max_count:\n                max_count = frequency[num]\n                most_frequent = num\n        return most_frequent\n\n    def radix_sort(arr):\n        if not arr:\n            return arr\n        max_digit = max(arr)\n        exp = 1\n        while max_digit // exp > 0:\n            count = [0] * 10\n            output = [0] * len(arr)\n\n            for i in arr:\n                index = i // exp % 10\n                count[index] += 1\n\n            for i in range(1, 10):\n                count[i] += count[i - 1]\n\n            i = len(arr) - 1\n            while i >= 0:\n                index = arr[i] // exp % 10\n                output[count[index] - 1] = arr[i]\n                count[index] -= 1\n                i -= 1\n\n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                arr[i] = output[i]\n\n            exp *= 10\n        return arr\n\n    most_frequent = most_frequent_element(orders)\n    unique_mine_output = list(set(mine_output))\n    sorted_mine_output = radix_sort(unique_mine_output)\n    return (most_frequent, sorted_mine_output)", "entry_point": "enchanted_marketplace_gemstone_sort", "test": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([3, 3, 5, 3, 7, 9, 3], [7, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 9]) == (3, [2, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n    assert candidate([4, 4, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1]) == (4, [1])\n    assert candidate([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]) == (1, [3, 4, 5])\n    assert candidate([6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 6], [10, 9, 8, 10, 9, 11]) == (6, [8, 9, 10, 11])\n    assert candidate([12, 13, 14, 12, 12], [100, 101, 102, 100]) == (12, [100, 101, 102])", "invalid_reason": "Valid with warnings: [\"5, Incorrect Problem Assumption: The problem guarantees that there will always be a unique most frequently occurring gemstone in the 'orders' list, but this is a significant assumption that may not hold in real cases and significantly limits the input variety. This restricts the problem from handling edge cases where two or more gemstone types might have the same frequency in the 'orders' list, potentially leading to ambiguities in defining the most frequent type without additional rules or tie-breaking logic.\", \"4, Radix Sort Requirements: Radix Sort is intended for sorting numbers and is efficient for fixed-length integer representations. The problem statement should specify that all gemstone types in 'mine_output' are non-negative integers or explicitly handle cases where gemstone types could be negative or non-integer values. Ensuring that Radix Sort is only applied to appropriate data types is crucial for correct algorithm functioning.\"]"}
