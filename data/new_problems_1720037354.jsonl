Each building has multiple meeting rooms and paths connecting these rooms can have varying visual vibrancy based on how 'visually appealing' they are (for example, paths with artwork, windows, or interesting architecture are considered more vibrant).\n\n    You are given a topographical floorplan of the office complex with a set of meeting rooms and a matrix representing the office layout. In the matrix:\n    - The elements are positive integers which denote the visual vibrancy score of the path.\n    - The rows and columns respectively represent corridors and intersections between these corridors.\n    - A '0' in the matrix denotes the absence of a direct path between intersections.\n\n    Your task is to find the most visually vibrant route between any two meeting rooms keeping in mind you would want to maximize the visual experience while moving from one meeting room to another.\n\n    Write a function that takes a list of coordinates of meeting rooms and a square matrix representing the office layout and returns the route that has the highest cumulative visual vibrancy score between the two most distant meeting rooms. Use a variation of Dijkstra's Algorithm adapted for maximizing vibrancy instead of minimizing distance.\n\n    Additionally, incorporate an algorithm to extract the longest palindromic substring from a given path's corridor numbers as a string, to determine the symmetry of that path which could make it more visually striking.\n\n    Example:\n    meeting_rooms = [(0, 2), (1, 3)]\n    office_layout = [\n        [0, 1, 4, 2],\n        [1, 0, 2, 9],\n        [4, 2, 0, 3],\n        [2, 9, 3, 0]\n    ]\n    Output: ('0430', '0')\n    The function should return a tuple where the first element represents the most vibrant path between the two most distant meeting rooms calculated using a modified Dijkstra's Algorithm and the second element represents the longest palindromic substring that appears in the determined path.\n    \"\"\"\n", "canonical_solution": "def best_route_visual(meeting_rooms, office_layout):\n    import heapq\n\n    def vibrant_dijkstra(office_layout, start):\n        n = len(office_layout)\n        max_vibrancy = [-float('inf')] * n\n        max_vibrancy[start] = 0\n        priority_queue = [(-max_vibrancy[start], start, str(start))]\n        while priority_queue:\n            curr_vibrancy, u, path = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n            if -curr_vibrancy > max_vibrancy[u]:\n                continue\n            for v in range(n):\n                if office_layout[u][v] > 0 and max_vibrancy[v] < max_vibrancy[u] + office_layout[u][v]:\n                    max_vibrancy[v] = max_vibrancy[u] + office_layout[u][v]\n                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (-max_vibrancy[v], v, path + str(v)))\n        return max_vibrancy, path\n\n    def longest_palindrome(s):\n        if not s:\n            return ''\n        dp = [[False] * len(s) for _ in range(len(s))]\n        max_length = 1\n        palindrome_start = 0\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            dp[i][i] = True\n        for length in range(2, len(s) + 1):\n            for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):\n                end = i + length - 1\n                if length == 2:\n                    dp[i][end] = (s[i] == s[end])\n                else:\n                    dp[i][end] = (s[i] == s[end] and dp[i + 1][end - 1])\n                if dp[i][end] and length > max_length:\n                    max_length = length\n                    palindrome_start = i\n        return s[palindrome_start: palindrome_start + max_length]\n\n    distances_from_rooms = [vibrant_dijkstra(office_layout, room[0] * len(office_layout) + room[1]) for room in meeting_rooms]\n    max_route = max(distances_from_rooms, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    most_vibrant_path = max_route[1]\n    longest_palindromic_part = longest_palindrome(most_vibrant_path)\n    return (most_vibrant_path, longest_palindromic_part)", "entry_point": "best_route_visual", "test": "def check(candidate):\n    meeting_rooms = [(0, 2), (1, 3)]\n    office_layout = [\n        [0, 1, 4, 2],\n        [1, 0, 2, 9],\n        [4, 2, 0, 3],\n        [2, 9, 3, 0]\n    ]\n    assert candidate(meeting_rooms, office_layout) == ('0430', '0')\n\n    meeting_rooms = [(0, 0), (3, 3)]\n    office_layout = [\n        [0, 5, 0, 0],\n        [5, 0, 7, 0],\n        [0, 7, 0, 8],\n        [0, 0, 8, 0]\n    ]\n    assert candidate(meeting_rooms, office_layout) == ('0123', '0')\n\n    # More tests\n    meeting_rooms = [(0, 0), (2, 3)]\n    office_layout = [\n        [0, 2, 5, 1],\n        [2, 0, 3, 9],\n        [5, 3, 0, 7],\n        [1, 9, 7, 0]\n    ]\n    assert candidate(meeting_rooms, office_layout) == ('023', '0')\n\n    meeting_rooms = [(1, 1), (3, 2)]\n    office_layout = [\n        [0, 6, 4, 0],\n        [6, 0, 0, 3],\n        [4, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 3, 2, 0]\n    ]\n    assert candidate(meeting_rooms, office_layout) == ('112', '1')\n\n    meeting_rooms = [(0, 1), (2, 2)]\n    office_layout = [\n        [0, 4, 0, 0],\n        [4, 0, 2, 0],\n        [0, 2, 0, 3],\n        [0, 0, 3, 0]\n    ]\n    assert candidate(meeting_rooms, office_layout) == ('0122', '2')", "extra_info": {"cover_story_words": ["office", "city"], "topics": ["Longest Palindromic Substring", "Dijkstra's Algorithm"], "cleaned_prompt": "Implement a function best_route_visual which identifies the most visually vibrant path between two distant meeting rooms in an office complex given their coordinates and a matrix denoting the office layout where each element represents the vibrancy of the path.
