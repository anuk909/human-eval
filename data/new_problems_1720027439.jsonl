The scenario is defined with three grids of equal dimensions:\n\n    - 'energy_grid': A 2D list with each cell containing a positive integer that represents the energy level at that position.\n    - 'minimum_energy': A 2D list specifying the minimum energy threshold required for each node to be active.\n    - 'layout': A grid consisting of '0's and '1's where '1' signifies an active area of the restaurant (i.e., an area that contains energy nodes which are considered for computation).\n\n    Tasks:\n    - Identify connected components of cells in the energy grid that meet or exceed their corresponding values in 'minimum_energy'. Each cell can connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right) to its adjacent neighbors.\n    - Compute the shortest path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the identified largest connected component using the sum of energy values as path weights. Return -1 if no valid path exists.\n\n    Note: Only cells marked as '1' in the layout are considered for determining connectivity and path computation.\n\n    Example:\n    energy_grid = [[5, 4], [6, 8]]\n    minimum_energy = [[3, 4], [10, 8]]\n    layout = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]\n    Output: 24 (since the available path from top-left to bottom-right goes through cells meeting their energy thresholds).\n    \"\"\"\n", "canonical_solution": "    def find_largest_connected_component_and_min_path(energy_grid, minimum_energy, layout):\n        rows, cols = len(energy_grid), len(energy_grid[0])\n        def is_within_bounds(x, y):\n            return 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols\n\n        # Check if the energy level meets the threshold and it is within layout\n        def is_valid(x, y):\n            return layout[x][y] == 1 and energy_grid[x][y] >= minimum_energy[x][y]\n\n        # Use DFS to explore nodes, marking them and finding connected components\n        def dfs(x, y, visit_mark):\n            stack = [(x, y)]\n            component = []\n            while stack:\n                cx, cy = stack.pop()\n                if (cx, cy) not in visit_mark:\n                    visit_mark.add((cx, cy))\n                    component.append((cx, cy))\n                    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                        nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy\n                        if is_within_bounds(nx, ny) and is_valid(nx, ny):\n                            stack.append((nx, ny))\n            return component\n\n        # Discover all valid components\n        all_components = []\n        visited = set()\n        for r in range(rows):\n            for c in range(cols):\n                if is_valid(r, c) and (r, c) not in visited:\n                    component = dfs(r, c, visited)\n                    if component:\n                        all_components.append(component)\n\n        # Find the largest component based on length\n        largest_component = max(all_components, key=len, default=[]) \n        if not largest_component:\n            return -1  # No valid path exists\n\n        # Find the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right within the largest component\n        min_path_sum = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n        min_path_sum[0][0] = energy_grid[0][0] if is_valid(0, 0) else float('inf')\n        queue = [(0, 0)]\n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.pop(0)\n            current_sum = min_path_sum[x][y]\n            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if is_within_bounds(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) in largest_component and current_sum + energy_grid[nx][ny] < min_path_sum[nx][ny]:\n                    min_path_sum[nx][ny] = current_sum + energy_grid[nx][ny]\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n        # If the bottom-right is unreachable or not part of the component, return -1\n        if min_path_sum[-1][-1] == float('inf'):\n            return -1\n        return min_path_sum[-1][-1]\n\n    return find_largest_connected_component_and_min_path(energy_grid, minimum_energy, layout)\n", "test": "def check(candidate):\n    # Example test cases\n    assert candidate([[5, 4], [6, 8]], [[3, 4], [10, 8]], [[1, 1], [1, 1]]) == 24\n    assert candidate([[10, 15], [20, 25]], [[12, 16], [18, 20]], [[1, 1], [1, 1]]) == 55\n    assert candidate([[3, 6, 3], [5, 2, 5], [6, 1, 8]], [[4, 5, 6], [5, 3, 4], [3, 5, 6]], [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]) == -1\n    assert candidate([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]], [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]) == -1\n    assert candidate([[5, 5], [5, 5]], [[3, 4], [4, 3]], [[1, 1], [1, 1]]) == 20\n", "entry_point": "energy_paths", "extra_info": {"cover_story_words": ["energy vortex", "restaurant"], "topics": ["Minimum Path Sum", "Strongly Connected Component"], "cleaned_prompt": "Write a function that takes three 2D lists, 'energy_grid', 'minimum_energy', and 'layout'.
